# Low-weight_Codeword_Problem

he GitHub repository contains a MATLAB application for generating a script for Magma Code Distance estimation using the Brouwer-Zimmerman method. The tool make  generator matrix for  LW_1280_3 code with rate=1/2 (seed 3)  from https://decodingchallenge.org/low-weight/ and run Brouwer-Zimmerman code (Hamming) distance using Magma V2.22-3.

To learn more about Magma implementation, refer to "Searching for linear codes with large minimum distance" by Martin Grassl, published in the book "Discovering Mathematics with Magma" in 2006.

For more information on the Brouwer-Zimmerman method, refer to the following papers: "Bounds on Linear Codes" by Andries E. Brouwer, published in the Handbook of Coding Theory in 1998; "Integral Hecke Modules, Integral Generalized Reed-Muller Codes, and Linear Codes" by K.-H. Zimmermann, published as Technical Report 3-96 by Technische Universit√§t Hamburg-Harburg in 1996; and "Codierungstheorie: Konstruktionen und Anwendungen linearer Codes" by A. Betten, H. Fripertinger, A. Kerber, A. Wassermann, and K.-H. Zimmermann, published by Springer in 1998.
